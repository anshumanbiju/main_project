00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,760
So, what's new Mark? How is your new job going?

2
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:26,280
To be honest, I can't complain. I really love the company that I am working for.

3
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:33,280
My co-workers are all really friendly and helpful. They really help me feel welcome.

4
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:43,280
It's a really energetic and fun atmosphere. My boss is hilarious and he's really flexible.

5
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,280
Really? How so?

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,280
He allows me to come in when I want and make my own hours.

7
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,280
I can also leave early if I start early. There is no real dress code either.

8
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:08,280
I can wear jeans and a t-shirt if I want. I can even wear shorts in the summer.

9
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:16,280
Wow. It sounds really cool. I can't stand wearing a suit every day.

10
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,280
Which do you prefer? Working late or finishing early?

11
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:31,280
I prefer finishing early. I really enjoy the morning. I love getting up early and going for a run.

12
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,280
There is nothing like watching the sunrise while drinking my morning coffee.

13
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,280
Really? I am opposite. I love sleeping in.

14
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:53,280
I am most alert in the evenings. I'm a real night owl.

15
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,280
Well, you know what they say. The early bird catches the worm.

16
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:08,280
You know, you could be right. Maybe I will try to go to bed a little earlier tonight.
